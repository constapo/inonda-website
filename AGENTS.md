# INONDA LTD website instructions

- The owner explicitly authorized coordinated public updates and referrals between inonda.site, inonda.org and inonda.homes. Do not change DNS or repository visibility.
- Preserve existing page content, language URLs, search metadata, forms and the official company logo. No fabricated reviews or customer claims. Use company media only.
- inonda.site explains property management; inonda.org explains maintenance, repairs and renovation; inonda.homes provides editable planning estimates, not fixed quotations.
- Shared navigation and website cards come from tools/inonda_network.py and tools/network-copy.json. Keep those source files synchronized with the other two INONDA repositories. Run python tools/inonda_network.py site after shared-copy updates.
- All six languages (el, en, ru, uk, he, ro) must link to both other INONDA websites in the selected language. Hebrew retains RTL.
- Carry only allowlisted service IDs and named areas to the estimator, with no personal data, notes or saved plans. Specialist trade work is not covered by the estimator’s general handyman allowance.
- Preserve 19% VAT-inclusive estimates on inonda.homes and its commercial pricing. Do not display the commercial adjustment percentage in public copy.
- Company: HE490415; all-Cyprus coverage. Contact Irina +35794091616, Constantin +35794091613, inonda2026@outlook.com. Call, inspection, then written offer. Do not send messages during testing.
- Read README.md. The main branch deploys automatically on Wasmer. Inspect current remote main and preserve concurrent edits; use expected_sha leases. Verify the live domain after deployment.

- The owner explicitly requested original WhatsApp and Viber brand icons. Local original files are whatsapp-official.svg and viber-official.svg; provenance is in BRAND-ASSETS.md. This is an explicit exception to the company-only media rule for communication-channel icons. Do not replace brand symbols with letters or recolour them.
- The same six-language guided chatbot runs on all three websites from tools/inonda_chat.js, tools/inonda_chat.css, tools/chat-copy.json and tools/chat-ui.json. It is an automated local service guide, not a generative AI or a human. Requests open WhatsApp/email drafts only on a visitor’s explicit click; no automatic sending, booking or quote confirmation.

- Footer social profiles use tools/social-links.json. Preserve the owner-supplied Facebook and Instagram company URLs. TikTok is the confirmed company profile https://www.tiktok.com/@inonda26; YouTube is https://www.youtube.com/@InondaLTD. Do not substitute guessed or generic profiles. LinkedIn remains excluded.

- The owner explicitly requested social-media brand icons in every footer. Preserve the self-hosted facebook-brand.svg, instagram-brand.svg, tiktok-brand.svg and youtube-brand.svg assets and their attribution comments. The company-only photography rule does not exclude these requested platform brand symbols.

- Increment the shared VERSION before changing cached shared assets, and regenerate all affected pages. Keep versioned static-asset URLs. The Staticfile host currently ignores legacy settings/config.toml overrides; verify actual response headers before claiming a cache change.

- Free-search promotion: see SEARCH-SETUP.md. Preserve tools/inonda_seo.py and tools/search-config.json across builds. Public search ownership tokens are deliberately public and are not login credentials. The owner confirmed a service-area business visiting customers; do not invent a walk-in office, opening hours, ratings or accreditation.

- Latest owner correction (25 October 2026): Facebook https://www.facebook.com/inondalimited and Instagram https://www.instagram.com/inondaltd replace all earlier profile URLs, including schema and listing drafts. Preserve the social brand icons.

- Mandatory owner rule (30 October 2026): all three INONDA websites must display social media brand symbols in their original brand colours, never monochrome or recoloured to the INONDA palette. Preserve Facebook blue, Instagram gradient, TikTok black/cyan/red, YouTube red, WhatsApp green and Viber purple, including hover/focus states.
- Photo rule (owner, 12 November 2026): a service photo must show exactly the service named beside it. If no company photo matches, leave the drawn icon (image key None/null) rather than reuse a near match.
- Team names (owner decision, 13 November 2026): Constantin and Irina stay in Latin letters, except Greek pages (Κωνσταντίν, Ειρήνη) and Russian pages (Константин, Ирина). Never 'Constantine'. Visible names are marked translate="no" by protect_names in tools/inonda_network.py and by the chat guide.
